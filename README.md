# Simva Unity Plugin

The  is a Unity (https://unity.com/) asset that simplifies use of Simva study process with the gameplay activity in witch it will be integrated and external pre-post activities (survey, manual, etc.) using the same user in all those activities.

Simva Unity Plugin has been developed by the [e-UCM group](https://www.e-ucm.es) and is part of the e-UCM ecosystem of tools for Learning Analytics (Simva, T-mon, Pumva, Î¼fasa and Xasu).

# Quick Start Guide

Simva Unity Plugin requires at least **Unity 2019.4 (LTS)**.

## Installation

Simva Unity Plugin can be downloaded through the Unity Package Manager using the [repository link](https://github.com/e-ucm/simva-unity-plugin.git) of this project.

To add it to your proyect:
* Go to ``Window > Package Manager``
* Press the "+" icon.
* Select ``Add package from git...``.
* Insert ```https://github.com/e-ucm/simva-unity-plugin.git``` 
* Press "Add".

If you want to manually include Simva Unity Plugin into your project (for example, by downloading the repository as a .zip), make sure you install also the NewtonSoft.JSON library and Xasu from ```https://github.com/e-ucm/xasu.git``` using the Unity Package Manager.

## Setting up the configuration file

The Simva Unity Plugin configuration file contains settings for overall Simva system. The configuration can be provided either using the `StreamingAssets` folder (recommended) or via scripting. We recommend using the `StreamingAssets` folder to allow configuration to be changed after the game is exported, allowing simpler adaptation of the game to different scenarios without having to recompile the whole game.

### Minimal "simva.conf"

The configuration file must be placed in:

```path
Assets/StreamingAssets/simva.conf
```

The following configuration file represents the study configuration required to process the study using oauth2 authentication via keycloak.

```json
 {
  "study": "<study-id>",
  "host": "<simva-hostname>",
  "url": "<simva-homePageUrl-for-actor-in-traces>",
  "protocol": "<simva-protocol>",
  "port": "<simva-port>",
  "sso": "<sso-openid-url>",
  "client_id": "<client-id>"
}
```

### Simva Wizard Window

You can conect to Simva via this login Wizard :

In you don't have any study configured you can create a study via the wizard that will create a group with the chosen number of participants, a pre/post (optional) and the gameplay activity to store the data in Simva:

### Initializing SimvaPlugin

When SimvaPlugin is added to your scene it will not initialize and connect by default.

To initialize it automatically, please check the "Auto Start" property in the object inspector.
You can also check "Enable Debug Log" to display debug logs in Unity console.

You need to configure some others parameters : 
* Save Auth Until Completed : toggle to save auth until completed

* Continue On Quit : 
* Enable Login Demo Button : enable Demo button in Login scene
* Enable Language Scene : if enable you can select witch language you want to add to your game language screen that will adapt automatically depending of the number of languages presents to be able to display all languages in same screen.

## Finalizing SimvaPlugin

Before the game is closed, SimvaPlugin has to be finalized manually so the processors of Xasu (online, offline or backup) can perform their final tasks and display the Post Survey if any to the user.

```cs
    bool wants = await Simva.SimvaPlugin.Instance.WantsToQuit();
    Debug.Log("Tracker finalized, game is now ready to close...");
    if (wants)
    {
        if (Application.isEditor)
        {
#if UNITY_EDITOR
            UnityEditor.EditorApplication.isPlaying = false;
#endif
        } else {
            Application.Quit();
        }
    }
```
